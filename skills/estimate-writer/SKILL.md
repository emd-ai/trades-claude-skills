# Estimate Writer

Generates a complete, professional estimate in your business's voice — ready to send to the customer in under 2 minutes.

## What you need to tell me

- **Customer name and address**
- **Job description** (as rough or detailed as you have it — I'll structure it)
- **Parts/materials needed** (if known — even approximate)
- **Your labour rate** ($/hr or flat rate)
- **Any extras** (call-out fee, permits, disposal, travel)
- **Your payment terms** (e.g. 50% upfront, balance on completion)
- **Your business name** (first time only — I'll remember it for the session)

## What I'll produce

### 1. The Estimate Document
Professional, structured, ready to print or email as a PDF:

```

### 2. Send Message (SMS or email)
The message to send alongside the estimate:

> "Hi [Name], estimate attached for the [job type] at [address]. All-in price is $[X]. Happy to answer any questions — just call or text. Valid for 30 days. [Your name]"

### 3. Follow-Up Sequence (if customer goes quiet)

**Day 3 (if no response):**
> "Hi [Name], just checking you received the estimate I sent for the [job]. Happy to talk through it — no pressure. [Your name]"

**Day 7 (if still no response):**
> "Hi [Name], last follow-up on the estimate for [job]. If the timing or budget doesn't work right now, no problem at all. If you'd like to revisit later or adjust the scope, just let me know. [Your name]"

After day 7 — move on. Two follow-ups is professional. Three is annoying.

## Example

**You say:**
> Quote for Tom at 88 River Road. Panel upgrade — 100A to 200A. About 6 hours labour at $95/hr. Parts around $400. I charge a $75 call-out. 50% upfront.

**I produce:** a complete formatted estimate with all figures, the text message to Tom, and a 3-day and 7-day follow-up message ready to copy.

## Tips for better estimates

- **Always list what's NOT included** — this prevents every dispute
- **Include a warranty line** — even "labour guaranteed for 12 months" builds trust
- **Name the specific products** where possible — "Leviton 200A panel" not just "new panel"
- **Round labour to half-hours** — it looks more professional than decimal hours

## Make it yours

First time you use this, tell me:
- Your business name and trade
- Your standard labour rate
- Your standard payment terms
- Any standard warranty you offer

I'll apply these to every estimate automatically for the rest of the session.
