description: Use this skill when you need to respond to a customer complaint — email, phone, BBB, or in-person dispute. Triggers on phrases like "customer is complaining about", "got a complaint about", "BBB complaint", "customer wants a refund", "dispute about the work", "angry customer email", or "how do I respond to this complaint". Produces a professional response letter plus an internal incident log. Do NOT use for public Google reviews — use review-responder for those. This is for private dispute resolution.

# Complaint Resolution Writer

**An unresolved complaint costs you 10+ referrals.** A well-handled one can turn into your most loyal customer.

This skill produces professional response letters for any customer dispute — billing, quality, scheduling, warranty claims, or scope disagreements. It also generates an internal incident log to protect you if the complaint escalates to a licensing board, BBB, or small claims court.

## The difference from review-responder

| | Review Responder | Complaint Resolution Writer |
|---|---|---|
| **Where** | Public (Google, Yelp) | Private (email, phone, BBB) |
| **Length** | Under 150 words | As long as needed — detailed |
| **Tone** | Friendly, brief | Professional, factual, protective |
| **Goal** | Look good to other readers | Resolve the issue and protect yourself |
| **Legal risk** | Low | Medium-high — documentation matters |

## What you need to tell me

- **Customer name**
- **What happened** (their complaint — in their words if you have it, or your summary)
- **Your side of the story** (what actually happened — be honest, I'll frame it properly)
- **The original scope/price** (what was agreed to)
- **What you've already done** (any calls, visits, attempts to fix)
- **What you're willing to offer** (e.g. "re-do the work", "partial refund of $200", "nothing — we did it right")
- **Is there a contract or written agreement?** (yes/no)

## What I'll produce

### 1. Response Letter (email or print)

Professional, measured, and factual. Structured to:
- Acknowledge the concern without admitting liability
- Reference the original scope of work
- State the facts chronologically
- Offer a specific resolution
- Set a deadline for response

```

```

### 4. Follow-Up After Resolution (if they accept)

We genuinely appreciate your patience, and I want you to know the feedback you gave us has led to [specific change — e.g. 'updating our scheduling process' / 'adding a final walkthrough to every install']. If you ever need anything, please don't hesitate to reach out. — [Your name], [Business]"

This message is optional but powerful — 30% of well-resolved complaints result in positive referrals.

### 5. Escalation Letter (if they reject your resolution)

Use this only if the customer rejects a reasonable offer and you need to protect yourself:

```
[BUSINESS NAME]
[Date]

Dear [Customer Name],

completed on [date], we have made the following good-faith
effort to resolve your concerns:

scope of work [and/or applicable building codes], and our
resolution offer of [specific offer] remains available,
we consider this matter addressed from our end.

by [date]. We remain committed to a fair resolution.

Respectfully,
[Your name]
[Business Name]
[Phone] | [Email] | [Licence #]
```

**Important:** This is a factual record, not legal advice. For complaints involving significant money, personal injury, or licensing board action, consult an attorney.

## Common complaint types and how to handle them

| Complaint | Key principle |
|-----------|--------------|
| **"Work was done wrong"** | Offer to inspect and re-do if warranted. Never argue quality over text. |
| **"Price was higher than quoted"** | Reference the original estimate/contract. If extras were approved verbally, note that. |
| **"You damaged my property"** | Take it seriously immediately. Inspect, photograph, and involve insurance if needed. |
| **"You missed the appointment"** | Apologise directly. Offer priority rescheduling. No excuses. |
| **"It broke again after you fixed it"** | Warranty callback — inspect at no charge. If it's a new issue, explain clearly. |
| **"Your tech was rude"** | Apologise without qualifying. "That's not our standard" — offer a different tech. |

## Setup (first time only)

Tell me:
- Your business name and trade
- Your phone number and email
- Your licence number (included in formal letters for credibility)
- Your standard warranty terms
- Do you have contracts/written estimates? (helps me reference them)

I'll apply these to every response automatically.
