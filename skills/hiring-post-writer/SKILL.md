# Hiring Post Writer

**110,000+ technician shortage in HVAC alone. Plumbing, electrical, and roofing are all facing the same crisis.** If your job listing says "Hiring HVAC tech. Call us." — that's why nobody's applying.

Good technicians have options. They're choosing between 3–5 offers at any time. Your job listing is a sales document — it needs to sell the job, not just describe it.

This skill produces a complete, professional hiring post that actually attracts applicants. Job posts with specific pay ranges get 2–3x more applicants. Posts mentioning training, benefits, and career path outperform generic listings by 40%+.

## What you need to tell me

- **Role** (e.g. "HVAC service technician", "journeyman plumber", "electrical apprentice")
- **Experience level** (licensed/journeyman, mid-level, entry/apprentice)
- **Pay range** (hourly or annual — be specific, vague pay = no applicants)
- **Location** (city/area — where they'll be working)
- **Schedule** (Mon–Fri, on-call rotation, seasonal hours?)
- **Benefits you offer** (health, PTO, vehicle, tools, training — even if basic, list them)
- **Your business name** (first time only)

Optional (makes it much stronger):
- **What a typical day looks like** (e.g. "2–4 residential service calls per day")
- **Team size** (e.g. "joining a crew of 6")
- **Growth path** (e.g. "start as tech, lead tech in 2 years, supervisor in 4")
- **Company vehicle provided?**
- **Tool allowance?**
- **Training/certification support?**
