name: job-proposal-writer
description: Use this skill when you need to write a full project proposal for a large or competitive job ($5K+). Triggers on phrases like "write a proposal for", "put together a bid for", "need a proposal for this job", "competing for a job", or "need to win this bid". Produces a multi-page proposal with scope, pricing options, timeline, and credentials — not just a price. Do NOT use for simple quotes under $5K — use estimate-writer for those.

# Job Proposal Writer

**The difference between a quote and a proposal is $5,000 in profit.**

For jobs over $5K where the customer is comparing multiple contractors, a one-page estimate won't win it. You need a proposal — a document that sells your company, not just your price.

Contractors who send professional proposals close 25–35% more large jobs. This skill produces a complete, presentation-ready proposal in under 10 minutes.

## When to use this vs. estimate-writer

| | Estimate Writer | Job Proposal Writer |
|---|---|---|
| **Job size** | Under $5K | Over $5K |
| **Competition** | You're the only quote | 2–4 contractors bidding |
| **Document** | 1 page — price + scope | 3–5 pages — persuasive bid |
| **Goal** | Inform | Win |

## What you need to tell me

- **Customer name and address**
- **Job description** (what they want done — as detailed as you have it)
- **Your price** (total or breakdown — I'll structure it into options)
- **Timeline** (how long the job takes, when you can start)
- **Any special qualifications** (certifications, years in business, past similar jobs)
- **Financing available?** (yes/no — if yes, what terms?)
- **Your business name and trade** (first time only)

Optional (makes it stronger):
- **A similar past job you've done** (brief — "Did a full rewire at 42 Pine for the Johnsons last year")
- **Equipment brands you use** (e.g. "Carrier", "Rheem", "Leviton")
- **Number of years in business**
- **Team size** (e.g. "crew of 3 for this job")

## What I'll produce

### 1. Cover Letter (half page)

Opens with the customer's problem, not your company. Shows you understand what they need, then positions your company as the right fit.

### 2. Scope of Work (1 page)

```
PROJECT SCOPE — [Job title]

INCLUSIONS
• [Specific task 1]
• [Specific task 2]
• [Specific task 3]

EXCLUSIONS (what's NOT included)
• [Item — e.g. "drywall repair after access cuts"]
• [Item — e.g. "permit fees (quoted separately)"]

DELIVERABLES
• [What the customer gets when you're done]
```

### 3. Pricing Options (1 page)

Three tiers — Good / Better / Best. Presenting options increases close rate from 42% to 52% (ACCA industry data).

```
OPTION A — STANDARD                    $[price]
[Core scope — gets the job done]

OPTION B — RECOMMENDED                 $[price]
[Core scope + upgrade that adds real value]

OPTION C — PREMIUM                     $[price]
[Everything in B + top-tier equipment/warranty]
```

Each option includes: what's included, equipment/materials, warranty, and monthly payment if financing is available.

**Financing line (if applicable):**
> "Option B: $[total] or $[monthly] /month for [X] months — 0% interest for qualified buyers."

Leading with monthly payments increases financing adoption from 21% to 42%.

### 4. Project Timeline (half page)

```
MILESTONE                    TARGET DATE

Signed agreement             [Date]

### 7. Send Message

> "Hi [Name], I've put together a detailed proposal for the [job] at [address]. It includes three options at different price points so you can choose what works best. I'm available [day] if you'd like to walk through it together. — [Your name], [Business]"

### 8. Follow-Up Sequence

**Day 3:**
> "Hi [Name], wanted to make sure you received the proposal I sent for [job]. Happy to walk through the options — even 10 minutes on the phone can help. No pressure. — [Your name]"

**Day 7:**
> "Hi [Name], last follow-up on the [job] proposal. If you'd like to adjust the scope or budget, I'm flexible. If you've already decided, no worries at all — thanks for considering us. — [Your name]"

**Day 14 (large jobs only):**
> "Hi [Name], just one final note — the pricing in the proposal is valid until [date]. After that I'd need to re-quote materials. Let me know if you have any questions. — [Your name]"

## Example

**You say:**
> Proposal for Sarah at 15 Elm Court. Full HVAC replacement — old R-22 system to new 16 SEER2. I quoted $12,800 for the standard option, could do a high-efficiency 20 SEER2 for $16,500. Timeline is 2 days. I can offer 0% financing for 18 months. We've been in business 14 years, fully licenced and insured.

**I produce:** A complete 4-page proposal with cover letter, scope, 3 pricing options (I'll create a middle tier), timeline, credentials, payment schedule, and a follow-up sequence.

## Why three options works

Industry data (ACCA survey):
- Contractors offering 1 option close at 42%
- Contractors offering 4+ options close at 52%
- Customers choose the middle option 60% of the time

This skill always produces three options. The middle one is labelled "RECOMMENDED" — that's where your best margin sits.

## Setup (first time only)

Tell me:
- Your business name and trade
- Years in business
- Key certifications or licences
- Standard payment terms
- Standard warranty
- Do you offer financing? (if yes, what terms?)
- Any past projects you're proud of (1–2 sentences each — I'll rotate these)

I'll apply these to every proposal automatically.
