# Service Agreement Writer

**Maintenance agreements are 55% of trades industry revenue.** If you don't offer them, you're leaving your most profitable revenue stream on the table.

A service agreement turns one-time customers into recurring revenue. The customer gets priority service and peace of mind. You get predictable cash flow year-round — no more feast-or-famine seasonal swings.

This skill produces a complete, professional agreement document plus everything you need to sell it.

## What you need to tell me

- **Your trade** (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, etc.)
- **What you want to include per visit** (e.g. "full system inspection, filter change, coil cleaning")
- **How many visits per year** (typically 1–2 for residential, 2–4 for commercial)
- **Your pricing** (per tier, or tell me your costs and I'll suggest pricing)
- **Any parts/labour discounts you want to offer** (e.g. "10% off parts for members")
- **Priority scheduling?** (yes/no — most businesses offer this for agreement customers)
- **Your business name** (first time only)

Optional:
- **Emergency response guarantee** (e.g. "same-day response for agreement customers")
- **No overtime charges?** (some plans include this for the premium tier)
- **Transferable?** (does it follow the customer or the property?)

### 2. Sales Script (for technicians on-site)

The best time to sell a maintenance agreement is right after you've finished a job and the customer is happy.

```
AFTER THE JOB — NATURAL TRANSITION:

"Everything's running great now. One thing I'd recommend —
[specific to their system, e.g. 'with a system this age' /
'since you've got a high-efficiency unit'] — is getting it
checked [once / twice] a year so small issues don't turn
into big repairs.

We have a maintenance plan that covers that — starts at
$[X] a month. You get [key benefit 1] and [key benefit 2],
plus [X]% off any parts if something does come up.

Most of our customers on the plan save $[X] a year in
avoided repairs. Want me to send you the details?"
```

**If they say "let me think about it":**
> "Absolutely — I'll email you the plan details tonight so you have it when you're ready. No pressure at all."

**Then send Touch 2 (see below).**

### 3. Email — Send After the Pitch (same day)

**Subject:** Your maintenance plan details — [Business Name]

> Hi [Name],
>
> Thanks again for having us out today — glad we got [the issue] sorted.
>
> As I mentioned, here are the maintenance plan options. Most of our residential customers go with Silver — it covers two visits a year plus priority scheduling, which means you skip the queue when something goes wrong.
>
> [Attach or paste the agreement tiers]
>
> Happy to answer any questions. You can sign up by replying to this email or calling us at [phone].
>
> [Your name]
> [Business Name]

### 4. Follow-Up (7 days later, if no response)

> "Hi [Name], just following up on the maintenance plan info I sent last week. No pressure — just wanted to make sure it didn't get buried in your inbox. If you have any questions, I'm happy to chat. — [Your name]"

### 5. Renewal Reminder (30 days before expiry)

> "Hi [Name], your [Silver] maintenance agreement with [Business] renews on [date]. Your next scheduled visit is [month]. Everything auto-renews — no action needed from you. If you'd like to upgrade your plan or make any changes, just reply here. Thanks for being a valued customer! — [Your name]"

## Trade-specific visit checklists

Tell me your trade and I'll include the right checklist in the agreement:

## Pricing guidance

If you're not sure what to charge, here are industry benchmarks:

Target: 250 agreements per $1M in annual revenue. If you're doing $500K/year, aim for 125 agreements.
