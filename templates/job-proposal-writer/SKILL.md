name: job-proposal-writer
description: Use this skill when you need to write a full project proposal for a large or competitive job ($5K+). Triggers on phrases like "write a proposal for", "put together a bid for", "need a proposal for this job", "competing for a job", or "need to win this bid". Produces a multi-page proposal with scope, pricing options, timeline, and credentials — not just a price. Do NOT use for simple quotes under $5K — use estimate-writer for those.

# Job Proposal Writer

## Pre-configured business data

This skill is configured for **{{BUSINESS_NAME}}**.
- Owner: {{OWNER_NAME}}
- Phone: {{PHONE}}
- Email: {{EMAIL}}
- Trade: {{TRADE}}
- Licence: {{LICENCE_NUMBER}}
- Years in business: {{YEARS_IN_BUSINESS}}
- Standard payment terms: {{PAYMENT_TERMS}}
- Standard warranty: {{WARRANTY_TERMS}}
- Financing available: {{FINANCING_TERMS}}
- Certifications: {{CERTIFICATIONS}}
- Past project reference: {{PAST_PROJECT_REFERENCE}}
- Tone: Write all outputs in a {{TONE_INSTRUCTION}} style.

**The difference between a quote and a proposal is $5,000 in profit.**

For jobs over $5K where the customer is comparing multiple contractors, a one-page estimate won't win it. You need a proposal — a document that sells your company, not just your price.

Contractors who send professional proposals close 25–35% more large jobs. This skill produces a complete, presentation-ready proposal in under 10 minutes.

## When to use this vs. estimate-writer

| | Estimate Writer | Job Proposal Writer |
|---|---|---|
| **Job size** | Under $5K | Over $5K |
| **Competition** | You're the only quote | 2–4 contractors bidding |
| **Document** | 1 page — price + scope | 3–5 pages — persuasive bid |
| **Goal** | Inform | Win |

## What you need to tell me

The following are pre-configured and applied automatically:
- Business name, phone, email, licence, certifications
- Years in business ({{YEARS_IN_BUSINESS}})
- Payment terms ({{PAYMENT_TERMS}})
- Warranty ({{WARRANTY_TERMS}})
- Financing ({{FINANCING_TERMS}})

You still need to tell me:
- **Customer name and address**
- **Job description** (what they want done)
- **Your price** (total or breakdown — I'll structure it into options)
- **Timeline** (how long the job takes, when you can start)
- **Any job-specific qualifications** (past similar work beyond the default reference)

## What I'll produce

### 1. Cover Letter (half page)

Opens with the customer's problem, not your company. Shows you understand what they need, then positions {{BUSINESS_NAME}} as the right fit.

### 2. Scope of Work (1 page)

```
PROJECT SCOPE — [Job title]

INCLUSIONS
• [Specific task 1]
• [Specific task 2]
• [Specific task 3]

EXCLUSIONS (what's NOT included)
• [Item]
• [Item]

DELIVERABLES
• [What the customer gets when you're done]
```

### 3. Pricing Options (1 page)

Three tiers — Good / Better / Best:

```
OPTION A — STANDARD                    $[price]
[Core scope — gets the job done]

OPTION B — RECOMMENDED                 $[price]
[Core scope + upgrade that adds real value]

OPTION C — PREMIUM                     $[price]
[Everything in B + top-tier equipment/warranty]
```

Each option includes monthly payment if financing is available:
> "Option B: $[total] or $[monthly]/month — {{FINANCING_TERMS}}"

### 4. Project Timeline (half page)

```
MILESTONE                    TARGET DATE
─────────────────────────────────────────
Signed agreement             [Date]
Materials ordered            [Date + X days]
Work begins                  [Date + X days]
[Key milestone]              [Date + X days]
Project complete             [Date + X days]
```

### 5. Why Choose {{BUSINESS_NAME}} (half page)

- {{YEARS_IN_BUSINESS}} years in business
- Certifications: {{CERTIFICATIONS}}
- {{PAST_PROJECT_REFERENCE}}
- Fully licenced ({{LICENCE_NUMBER}}) and insured
- Warranty: {{WARRANTY_TERMS}}

### 6. Terms & Acceptance (half page)

```
PAYMENT SCHEDULE
{{PAYMENT_TERMS}}

VALIDITY: This proposal is valid for 30 days.

ACCEPTED BY:
Customer: _________________ Date: _________
Contractor: ________________ Date: _________
```

### 7. Send Message

> "Hi [Name], I've put together a detailed proposal for the [job] at [address]. It includes three options at different price points so you can choose what works best. I'm available [day] if you'd like to walk through it together. — {{OWNER_NAME}}, {{BUSINESS_NAME}}"

### 8. Follow-Up Sequence

**Day 3:**
> "Hi [Name], wanted to make sure you received the proposal I sent for [job]. Happy to walk through the options — even 10 minutes on the phone can help. No pressure. — {{OWNER_NAME}}"

**Day 7:**
> "Hi [Name], last follow-up on the [job] proposal. If you'd like to adjust the scope or budget, I'm flexible. If you've already decided, no worries at all — thanks for considering us. — {{OWNER_NAME}}"

**Day 14 (large jobs only):**
> "Hi [Name], just one final note — the pricing in the proposal is valid until [date]. After that I'd need to re-quote materials. Let me know if you have any questions. — {{OWNER_NAME}}"

## Example

**You say:**
> Proposal for Sarah at 15 Elm Court. Full HVAC replacement — old R-22 system to new 16 SEER2. I quoted $12,800 for the standard option, could do a high-efficiency 20 SEER2 for $16,500. Timeline is 2 days.

**I produce:** A complete 4-page proposal with cover letter, scope, 3 pricing options (I'll create a middle tier), timeline, {{BUSINESS_NAME}} credentials, payment schedule, and a follow-up sequence.

## Why three options works

Industry data (ACCA survey):
- Contractors offering 1 option close at 42%
- Contractors offering 4+ options close at 52%
- Customers choose the middle option 60% of the time

This skill always produces three options. The middle one is labelled "RECOMMENDED" — that's where your best margin sits.
